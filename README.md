## Novel 3D Shape Representation
### [CVPR25] [3D Student Splatting and Scooping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10148)
This work proposes Student-t mixture model with both positive and negative components, optimized via principled SGHMC sampling. It achieves higher-fidelity and more arameter-efficient novel-view synthesis than 3DGS.

### [CVPR25] [3DCS:3D Convex Splatting: Radiance Field Rendering with 3D Smooth Convexes](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14974v2)
This work replaces Gaussians with smooth convexes to deliver sharper geometry, higher fidelity, and lower memory use while maintaining real-time rendering.

### [arxiv] [Triangle Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19175)
This work employs discrete, smooth triangles as 3D representation, integrating the traditional graphics pipeline with radiance-field rendering to achieve impressive results.

### [CVPR25] [Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-time High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04459)
This work incorporates a rasterization process on adaptive sparse voxels, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results, and compatible with grid-based 3D processing techniques.
